    "answer:-  An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an exceptional situation arises, Python raises an exception which can be caught and handled by the program to prevent the program from crashing or behaving unexpectedly. Exceptions provide a way to gracefully handle errors and unexpected situations in your code.\n",

    ">The difference between Exceptions and syntax errors\n",
    "Exceptions:\n",
    "1)Exceptions occur during the runtime execution of a program.\n",
    "2)They are raised when an error or unexpected situation occurs, such as dividing by zero, accessing a non-existent file, or attempting to use a variable that hasn't been defined.\n",
    "3)Exceptions can be caught and handled using try and except blocks, allowing the program to continue running with appropriate error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax Errors:\n",
    "1)Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, occur during the parsing of the code before it is executed.\n",
    "T2)hey are caused by incorrect syntax in the code, such as missing a closing parenthesis, using an invalid operator, or not following the correct indentation rules.\n",
    "3)Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all. The code needs to be fixed before it can be executed.\n"
